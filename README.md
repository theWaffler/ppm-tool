# Conversion tool

## Purpose
- This calculator is for **mass based chemistry**
- Suitable for **Nickel, Copper, Chrome salts, Boric acid**, etc
- Capable of generating reports

### Inputs
- **oz/lb** 

### Output
- **ppm (mg/L)**

### Conversion used
- 1oz/gal = 7,489ppm
- 1 oz -> 28.3495g 
- 1 US gal = 3.78541L 
- ppm = mg/L


Derived from:
- 1 oz = 28.3495 g  
- 1 US gal = 3.78541 L  
- ppm = mg/L  


## Important Safety Warning

⚠️ **Do NOT use this tool for:**
- %vol or %v additives
- ml or ml/AH additions
- Acids specified as %vol
- Chloride already specified in ppm

This tool is strictly for **mass-based (oz/gal) concentrations**.
